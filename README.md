**Gameboard**
 - Gameboard sets up the board with empty cells in an array.

**Player**
 - Creates a player.

**Game Handler**
 - Uses the above two to run the game. Checks to see if any player has won.
 
There are two players, Player1 and Player2. It is a 7 x 6 grid. Each player drops a chip (red or yellow) into a column. 
The point of the game is to get 4 chips in a row (hence the name), either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Good luck and have fun.
